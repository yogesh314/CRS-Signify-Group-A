Why TypeScript
	TypeScript is a modern compiler and modern java script language which is rapping up on top of the javascript tool
	
	TypeScript itself is a javascript with modern rules and regulation
	
	We need to install the typescript using npm extension in the node with the command npm install -g typescript
	
	TypeScript is providing us the next level of modern development based on add on concept in javascript
		New level of modifier -> public, private, protected ,readonly,Enum
		Varaities of function with default and optional parameters like interfeace , generaics stc
	
	We can create the typescript file with .ts extension
	
	How Ts compiler Works
		Source file (.ts) -> compile with .tsc -> convert to ES5 javascript 
	
Angular 13
	Angular 13 is a UI and UX framework based on MVC patterns 
		M -> Model (setter and getters and data properties)
		V -> Templates (the HTML code)
		C -> Controller 
	
	In the project creation of angular we used Angular CLI which is managing the complete life cycle of angular project like build deploy  test etc..
	
	For installation of angular CLI we use the following commands 
		npm install -g @angular/cli@13.2.0
	
	Angular cli and Npm are similer to the maven which are maintaining the complete life cycle of the project
	
	Navigation means routing
